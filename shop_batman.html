            <h1>Batman</h1>
            <p>There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
                You became the light on the dark side of me
                Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
                But did you know that when it snows
                My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
                Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
                Now that your rose is in bloom
                A light hits the gloom on the grey
                There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
                You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
                Baby, to me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
                Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
                But did you know that when it snows
                My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
                Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
                Now that your rose is in bloom
                A light hits the gloom on the grey
                I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
                I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
                And if I should fall, will it all go away?
                I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
                There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
                You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
                To me, you're like a growing, addiction that I can't deny
                Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
                But did you know that when it snows
                My eyes become large, and the light that you shine can be seen?

                A light hits the gloom on the grey
                Yes I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                Ooh, the more I get of you stranger it feels, yeah
                And now that your rose is in bloom
                A light hits the gloom on the grey
                Now that your rose is in bloom
